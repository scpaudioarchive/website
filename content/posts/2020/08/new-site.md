As you can tell, I've moved the SCP Foundation Audio Archive podcast's website!

The new address is: [https://scpaudioarchive.github.io/]().

Hopefully, this is easier to maintain and keep updated than my old site. All the useful links, spreadsheets, etc. have all been moved over.

(Yes, I am using Github pages to host this.) If you're really interested, here's the website's [public GH repository](https://github.com/scpaudioarchive/scpaudioarchive.github.io) - feel free to file an issue if there's something wrong. I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the theme [Ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke).

Quick update on my release schedule: I'm still aiming for at least 1 episode per week (Sunday), but hopefully soon it'll return to the usual 2.

Thanks for reading!
