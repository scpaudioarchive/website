I slightly messed up on today's episode.

The title and description was supposed to be SCP-125, not SCP-126 (that's this Sunday's episode). This was only on the podcast, and I did the Youtube video properly.

8 of you still managed to download it before I realized and updated it. Deleting the episode, refreshing and re-downloading should provide the appropriate metadata.

Apologies for the inconvenience! Just a quick post in case someone was wondering.
