As promised, here is the entirety of season 2 in one! It covers most SCPs from SCP-100 to SCP-149.

It is too long to upload as a podcast episode, so it is available on Youtube. In case you want to save bandwidth or listen offline, several audio files are available below.

**Thank you to all my listeners, patrons, donors, who made it possible. ðŸ–¤**
