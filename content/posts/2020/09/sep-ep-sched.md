My May - July release schedule was very infrequent, and thats something I want to avoid from now on. Season 2 has been going on since mid-April, and there's a strong chance that if I stay with the schedule, it can be finished by the end of the year.

## Release schedule for the rest of August

**Twice a week! Every Wednesday and Sunday until September 2.**

## Release schedule for the September...?

**I'm aiming for every Wednesday, every other Sunday.**

However, with COVID-19, I'll still be doing some form of school in September - blended (1 day in school and the other online) or fully online.

I will probably attend fully online, just because it's significantly safer and I don't trust my school with all the necessary safety precautions.

Because of this, I have no idea how busy I'll actually be. While I definitely want to finish Season 2 by the end of December and move onto bonus episodes, unfortunately I can't guarantee it ðŸ˜ž.

[Patrons](/support) will still release episodes as soon as I'm done editing them.

If there are any updates, I'll be sure to [announce them](/links).

I'll also keep trying to schedule YT live streamed recordings and [Discord recordings](/links), just keep in mind that they'll happen on weekends/ at night (EST).
