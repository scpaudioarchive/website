SCP-343: "God"

Read: http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-343

> Description: SCP-343 is a male, seemingly race-less, humanoid in appearance with apparent omnipotence. SCP-343 was discovered walking the streets of Prague and detained after a staff member witnessed him disappear from the streets and reappear on a rooftop. SCP-343 is detained willingly in his chamber, as containment has proved impossible (see notes).

I was originally intending to put up 2 bonus episodes today, but the second one will be delayed to Friday, sorry.
