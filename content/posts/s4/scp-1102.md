description: "SCP-1102 is a phenomenon localized in the Blue Ridge Mountain range in the eastern USA, though evidence suggests it may also include an area as far south as mid-Georgia and Alabama... The dominant urge in all subjects, human or otherwise, seems to be one of returning or rejoining other members of the original species."
