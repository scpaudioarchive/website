description: "SCP-1122 is an abandoned tourist attraction located on the outskirts of ███████████, ██. It was originally constructed in 195█ as a “house of tomorrow”, a demonstration of the then-futuristic technologies expected to become commonplace over the following twenty-five years. There is no evidence that SCP-1122 displayed any anomalous properties prior to its abandonment."
